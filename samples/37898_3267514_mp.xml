The original Jam Love Travel Tote is created from an original textile design inspired by British letterpress wood type in premium linen blend canvas wax coated to be water repellent. Two rolled tan leather top handles for carrying on arm or on shoulder and tan leather flap to front and bottom. Within the bag is a secure laptop/iPad clutch bag. Additionally, there are brass foot studs to protect the base of the tote. By using the leather flap, the bag transforms into a sleek facing design, with a security-conscious feature allowing the carrier to access the most-used items (travel card, purse, keys, mobile etc) from a zipped interior pocket (without having to open the whole bag).The handles have bridle leather on the outside and calf leather on the inside which, for a sturdy, robust, weight-carrying bag is an extremely important feature; strong enough with solid machine-stitching attaching them to the bag, yet crucially, not with the traditional piped lining inside that is far less comfortable when carried for longer periods. The engineering and careful stress testing of the Jam Love process is as much a part of the story as the bag design itself. Functional without cutting corners, simple styling without resorting to a monogrammed look. Bag comes with branded dustbag. Bag measures: W20&quot; x H12&quot; x D5&quot;, handle drop: 8&quot;.
